        </div>

        <p>{{appTitle}} is a virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple persons at the same time. Users will be
            anonymous - so no one needs to sign in.</p>

        <p>{{appTitle}} is free to use. It is built and shared by <a href="http://ulf.codes"
                                                                     target="_blank">Ulf&nbsp;Schneider</a>
            and it is developed while obeying the agile mantra: Make the simplest thing that
            will possibly work now. Validate. Repeat. Yay.

        <h3 id="writing-and-editing">Writing and editing</h3>

        <p>After creating or opening a session, you can write text by double clicking
            anywhere in the browser window. Already existing text can be edited by clicking on it. And hey, <a
                    href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">writing markdown</a> is
            supported.
        </p>

        <h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
        <p>Commands are started holding the key <kbd>⌘</kbd> on a Mac, and <kbd>CTRL</kbd> on other platforms. 
        Throughout this document <kbd>CMD</kbd> is used to describe either one of the command keys.
        </p>

        <h3 id="undo-and-redo">Undo and redo</h3>

        <p>Use <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> to undo your actions
            and <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> to redo the last action.
            You can only undo/redo what you have done by yourself during a session and not what other participants have done.</p>
        <h3 id="drag-and-resize">Drag and resize</h3>

        <p>Drag the text around and resize text boxes as you like.</p>

        <h3 id="multi-select">Multi select</h3>

        <p>Select multiple items by holding <kbd>CMD</kbd> and <kbd>CLICKING</kbd> on the items. Alternatively you can hold <kbd>CMD</kbd> and <kbd>DRAG</kbd> to draw a rectangle on the screen. Any item that is touched by the rectangle
            will be selected.</p>

        <h3 id="align">Align</h3>

        <p>When you have selected multiple items, you can align the items left with
            <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>←</kbd>. Align top, right or bottom by using the other
            arrow keys.</p>

        <h3 id="connect">Connect</h3>

        <p>Draw a connection from one item to the other by holding down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click on the
            parent item and then click on the child item. Finally release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to create a new item which should be connected to a parent, again, hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd>, click on the parent and then double click at the position inside of the browser window where the
            new item should be created. As the last step release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.</p>

        <p>You get rid of a connection by holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key while double clicking on the child item (the
            one the connection arrow is pointing to).</p>

        <h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>

        <p>Pick a new background color for your content by clicking on the colored
            rectangle in the topline, which will appear when hovering over your content. You have an intentionally
            reduced palette of colors, because scarcity brings clarity. The colors are translucent to help you
            identifying stacked content.</p>

        <h3 id="voting">Voting</h3>

        <p>Dot voting is possible by clicking on the ▲ symbol that appears top left when hovering
            over a text, down voting by clicking on the ▼ symbol.</p>

        <h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>

        <p>You can filter out those contents you are interested in, simply by typing a text
            pattern that has to be part of the contents you want to have on the screen (use the input area in the top
            left corner of the window). E.g. a filter of
            <mark>{{appTitle}}</mark>
            will show you everything that does contain the pattern
            <mark>{{appTitle}}</mark>
            . You can do negative filtering by putting the -- prefix in front of your
            filter. E.g.
            <mark>--{{appTitle}}</mark>
            will show you everything that does not contain the pattern <i>{{appTitle}}</i>.
            Filtering won´t affect the other participants of a shared whiteboard session and it will ignore case.
        </p>

        <h3 id="grid">Grid</h3>

        <p>In the top left corner you can define a grid in pixels. If you do so, elements will be snapped
            to that grid when they are dragged around or created. You can even define your grid in the URL of your
            whiteboard session, just by adding somethig like
            <mark>,grid:200x25</mark>
            to your URL. In this example 200 is the grid column width in pixels and 25 is the grid row height in pixels.
            Set a grid for columns only by adding
            <mark>,grid:200</mark>
            and for rows only by adding
            <mark>,grid:x25</mark>
            . The grid will be indicated on the canvas if the value for either columns or rows is at least {{minGrid}}
            or above. If you change your grid settings, the other participants of the whiteboard session will not be
            affected.
        </p>

        <h3 id="import">Import</h3>

        <p>You can import any .TXT file into {{appTitle}} by dragging and dropping the file on top of the {{appTitle}}
            editor window. Each line of the text file will become a seperate text object that will appear in your editor
            window.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also possible to import the .CSV files that are being created by {{appTitle}} as export files (see
            below, "Export").
            In these cases you can work with the exported session data and bring it back into another session. Please
            mind that the format needs to be .CSV - just like the export.
        </p>

        <h3 id="export">Export</h3>

        <p>You have done smart things with {{appTitle}} and want to work further on it with different tools? Use the
            export action in the header of the editor window to get a .csv file from your current session.
        </p>
